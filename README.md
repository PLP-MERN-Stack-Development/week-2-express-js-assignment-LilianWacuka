# Express.js RESTful API Assignment

This assignment focuses on building a RESTful API using Express.js, implementing proper routing, middleware, and error handling.

## Instructions To Run Assignment
. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <https://github.com/PLP-MERN-Stack-Development/week-2-express-js-assignment-LilianWacuka.git>
   cd <your-project-folder>
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install 
   npm init -y
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example` and fill in your values.

4. Start the server:
   ```
   1. install nodemon for server persistent
   use pnpm add nodemon
   npm start
   ```
   The server will run on `http://localhost:3000` by default.


## .env file
```
PORT=3000
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:YOUR URL
API_KEY=.....your/APIKEY
```
## Documentation of API endpoints
### Authentication
All endpoints (except `/`) require an API key in the header:
```
x-api-key: ''''
```

### Product Routes

| Method | Endpoint                   | Description                        |
|--------|----------------------------|------------------------------------|
| GET    | `/api/products`            | List all products (supports filtering and pagination) |
| GET    | `/api/products/:id`        | Get a product by ID                |
| POST   | `/api/products`            | Create a new product               |
| PUT    | `/api/products/:id`        | Update a product                   |
| DELETE | `/api/products/:id`        | Delete a product                   |
| GET    | `/api/products/search`     | Search products by name            |
| GET    | `/api/products/stats`      | Get product count by category      |

#### Query Parameters

- `category` (GET `/api/products`): Filter by category  
  Example: `/api/products?category=electronics`
- `page` and `limit` (GET `/api/products`): Pagination  
  Example: `/api/products?page=2&limit=5`
- `name` (GET `/api/products/search`): Search by name  
  Example: `/api/products/search?name=mouse`

## ðŸ“¦ Example Requests

### Create a Product

**POST** `/api/products`
```json
Headers:
  x-api-key: your-api-key
  Content-Type: application/json

Body:
{

  "price": 1200,
  "category": "electronics",
  "inStock": true
}
```

### Get Products by Category

## Assignment Overview

You will:
1. Set up an Express.js server
2. Create RESTful API routes for a product resource
3. Implement custom middleware for logging, authentication, and validation
4. Add comprehensive error handling
5. Develop advanced features like filtering, pagination, and search

## Getting Started

1. Accept the GitHub Classroom assignment invitation
2. Clone your personal repository that was created by GitHub Classroom
3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
4. Run the server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

## Files Included

- `Week2-Assignment.md`: Detailed assignment instructions
- `server.js`: Starter Express.js server file
- `.env.example`: Example environment variables file

## Requirements

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Postman, Insomnia, or curl for API testing

## API Endpoints

The API will have the following endpoints:

- `GET /api/products`: Get all products
- `GET /api/products/:id`: Get a specific product
- `POST /api/products`: Create a new product
- `PUT /api/products/:id`: Update a product
- `DELETE /api/products/:id`: Delete a product

## Submission

Your work will be automatically submitted when you push to your GitHub Classroom repository. Make sure to:

1. Complete all the required API endpoints
2. Implement the middleware and error handling
3. Document your API in the README.md
4. Include examples of requests and responses
